        by Diana Wynne Jones. Read more about him <a href="https://howlscastle.fandom.com/wiki/Calcifer">here</a>.

            <p>
                “A fire demon,” answered the purple mouth. There was more whine than spit to its voice as it said, “I'm
                bound to this hearth by contract. I can't move from this spot.”
            </p>
